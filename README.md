# W10LSWP

Super short, but also mostly useless script wrote on a rather boring night to save (basically, copy :sweat_smile:) Windows 10 Lockscreen Wallpapers (which happen to be truly wonderful!) to a directory of your choice.

That's all it does ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Requirements
- Python 3
    + PIL (Python Imaging Library) package
- Windows 10 (obviously :dizzy_face:)

### Usage
```bash
python win10wp.py <windows_username> <path\to\destination>
```

### Possible improvements
- [ ] Write a Windows service application to do the same, and do away with having to use Python (and it's packages! :smiley:)
- [ ] Watch for changes in the source directory, and perform copy
- [ ] Avoid rewrites :expressionless:
