# W10LSWP

Super short, but also mostly useless script wrote on a rather boring night to save (basically, copy :sweat_smile:) Windows 10 Lockscreen Wallpapers (which happen to be truly wonderful!) to a directory of your choice.

That's all it does ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Possible improvements
- [ ] Write a Windows service application to do the same
- [ ] Watch for changes in the source directory, and perform copy
- [ ] Avoid rewrites :expressionless:
